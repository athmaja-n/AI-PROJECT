RECOGNITION  OF FLOWER SPECIES

Project Description

Artificial intelligence is an approach to make a  computer, a robot,or a product to think how smart human think.AI is a study of how human brain think,learn,decide and work,when it tries to solve problems.And finally,this study outputs intelligent software systems. The aim of AI is to improve computer functions which are related to human knowledge, for example,reasoning, learning,and problem-solving.
     Automatic identification and recognition of flower species in environments such as forests,mountains and dense regions is necessary to know about their excistance.In recent years,plant species recognition is carried out based on the shape,geometry and texture of various plant parts such as leaves,flowers etc. Flower based plant species identification systems are widely used. While modern search engines provide methods to visually search for a query image that contains a flower, it lacks in robustness because of the intra-class variation among millions of flower species around the world. Hence in this proposed research work, a Deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used to recognize flower species with high accuracy. Images of the plant species are acquired using the built-in camera module of a mobile phone. Feature extraction of flower images is performed using a Transfer Learning approach (i.e. extraction of complex features from a pre-trained network). A machine learning classifier such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest is used on top of it to yield a higher accuracy rate. 
      This approach helps in minimizing the hardware requirement needed to perform the computationally intensive task of training a CNN. It is observed that, CNN combined with Transfer Learning approach as feature extractor outperforms all the handcrafted feature extraction methods such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Color Channel Statistics, Color Histograms, Haralick Texture, Hu Moments and Zernike Moments. CNN combined with Transfer Learning approach yields impressive Rank-1 accuracies of 73.05%, 93.41% and 90.60% using OverFeat, Inception-v3 and Xception architectures, respectively as Feature Extractors on FLOWERS102 dataset.
       Flower species recognition based on flower identification remain a challenge in Image processing and Computer Vision community mainly because of their vast existence, complex structure and unpredictable variety of classes in nature. Because of these natural complexities,it is highly undesirable to perform normal segmentation or feature extraction or combining shape,texture and color features which results in moderate accuracy on benchmark datasets.Although some feature extraction techniques combining global and local feature descriptors reaches state of the art accuracy in classifying flowers,still there is a need for a robust and efficient system to automatically identify and recognize flower larger scale in complex environment.
